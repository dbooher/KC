How to use
===================
Please follow the following steps:
1- Attach TextRevealer script to the gameobject containing your text component.
2- Make sure the "Target Text" field is pointing to that text component on the game object.
3- Change Reveal and Unreveal settings as desired.
4- Test how it will look like in the editor without having to run the game, by clicking "Preview Reveal" or "Preview Unreveal".
5- Make sure your gameobject and the text component are enabled when the game starts, the script will automatically hide them when the game starts.
6- Check the included Demo scene for various configurations.

Settings
==================
The following is a discription of each setting you'll find under the configuration section:

Auto Unreveal: Makes the text unreveal automatically after x seconds after the reveal has completed.
Reveal On Enabled: Automatically reveal text when object is enabled (Supports timeline ingegration with Activation Track to enable and disable the text gameobject (resulting in reveal / unreveal)). Also if the game starts while the objet is enabled, the text will reveal on start.
Unreveal On Disabled: Opposite of the previous option
Unreveal After (seconds): If Auto Unreveal is enabled, this is the amount of seconds it will wait before unrevealing the text after revealing is done.
Smooth Overlap: Enables smooth overlap feature, which makes the letters reveal/unreveal smoothly instead of each character waiting for the previous one to fully complete.
Smooth Overlap smoothness: Sets the degree of smoothness, NOTE: if you set this to maximum, characters will all start at the same time, which will enable the Scattered animation effect.
Animation Direction: The direction of movement each character takes, Horizontal/Vertical/Both.
Horizontal Direction: If Horizontal/Both are selected, this will let you set LeftToRight/RightToLeft/Randomize which will further let you control the direction of the character on the horizontal axis.
Min Horizontal Starting Distance: Minimum distance the character will travel.
Max Horizontal Starting Distance: Maximum distance the character will travel (the distance will be a random value between min and max UNLESS both min and max are the same value).
Horizontal Starting Distance Range: This is a slider control that lets you control the 2 values above, but you can set that in the 2 previous fields without having to move the sliders.
Vertical Direction: SAME AS BEFORE, but for Vertical axis.
Min Vertical Starting Distance: SAME AS BEFORE, but for Vertical axis.
Max Vertical Starting Distance: SAME AS BEFORE, but for Vertical axis.
Vertical Starting Distance Range: SAME AS BEFORE, but for Vertical axis.
Reveal Duration (Seconds): The total amount of time it takes to fully reveal the text.
Initial Opacity: The initial Opacity of the text (0 means the text will start invisible).
Final Opacity: The final opacity of the text (1 means the test will end up fully visible).
Apply Random Rotation: If enabled, the characters will appear to rotate randomly while moving to their destination.
Reverse: If enabled, the text will start revealing backwards (last character appears first).
OnRevealStarted(): A UnityEvent that lets you trigger custom logic when reveal is started, example: play a sound.
OnRevealComplete(): A UnityEvent that lets you trigger custom logic when reveal is competed.

The same above settings are repeated again but for the Unreveal Options.

Notes:
==================
The tool is compatible with Text, TextMeshPro, and TextMeshProUGUI. For TextMeshPro, you will have to install the TextMeshPro official unity package. (Demo scene only works if TextMeshPro is installed)
